## About

Dan watched as the internet slowly took over so many aspects of daily life. He reminisces fondly about the days when he would get most of his current affairs knowledge from a single session with the newspaper. He's not surprised at just how fast technology has changed and is willing to try new things! However he does find it hard to keep up with the waxing and waning of hype as new ideas are built, deployed and tested.
