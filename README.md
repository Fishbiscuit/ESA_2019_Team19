|Document|Description|Instruction from syllabus|
|--|--|--|
|Cover Page| need Team Name, Team Logo, member photos|Course name, semester/year, project title, project team members with photos; Must use names as they appear in eDimension; May use nicknames as well |
|Mission statement| need `Capella` diagram|A solution-neutral statement of the problem area and goal; Must use Capella|
|User characteristics| done |Affinity diagram based on at least 30 comments collected from interviews; Quality attributes; User persona; Use Capella to identify System Actors.|
|As Is and To BE Situation Maps| done|Influence diagrams displaying a network of factors influencing the mission (the target success factor) and a path or pathways from the system intervention to the mission; Must use Capella |for these maps. 
|Operational Concept| done |Single page artistic rendition of system in use, annotated with key features; This could be your favorite integrated concept sketch (from below).|
|Design Alternatives| done |Classification tree of design alternatives (research required); the importance of this step is to understand the key architectural decisions being made; Must use Capella for this diagram. Optional: Present a Concept-Combination Table (Morph Box) used to generate integrated concepts.|
|Integrated Conceps| done |This section is proof that you made some attempt to explore the design space. Propose at least five divergent (fundamentally distinct) integrated concepts which fulfill the operational concept; provide five concept sketches with annotated features. Every team member should contribute at least one sketch. |
|Scorecard|done|Functional requirements and quality attributes, with weights, that the user will use to score alternative solutions. These weights are inputs to the Concept Selection step. They should tie back to your User Characteristics analysis. |
|Concept Selection|done except justification for concept scoring (optional)|A Pugh matrix documenting how the scorecard was used to down-select to a final concept; Optional: present a hybrid design concept that dominates previous concepts. Optional: create an interactive Pugh matrix using R-Shiny (final submission) |
|Use Cases and Scenarios| need `Capella` diagram|At least one use case (scenario) per team member; Must use Capella; [Each scenario must be introduced in the Operational Analysis phase and carried through to the Logical Architecture phase (below).] The use cases must be sufficiently different to give rise to at least one new system functional requirement each. You must include at least one nominal use case and one off-nominal use case. Use Capella Capability Diagrams to represent the scenarios.|
|Scenario Analysis| using Activity Diagram + Swimlane in `Capella`|Behavior descriptions of use cases (scenarios); Must use Capella for these diagrams. Please use the Activity Diagram with Swimlanes style of diagram to describe the scenario. You may use the Sequence Diagram as well, but not in place of the Activity Diagram. Include diagrams for Operational Analysis and System Analysis in this section. |
|Chunked Design| using an Affinity spreadsheet refer to `Week1:Voice of the Customer`|Collect all the system functional requirements from the Systems Analysis phase of use case analysis. Collect all the artifacts used in the integrated concept sketches. Create an Affinity Spreadsheet merging these functions and artifacts into a single list. Then conduct an affinity exercise in which you group all these concepts into design chunks. If you have more than 7 chunks in your design, consider using a design structure matrix to perceive logical supersets. Name the resulting chunks as “subsystems.” |
|Logical Architecture|need `Capella` but for multiple scenarios|Document how the subsystems you have identified will cooperate to achieve the desired scenarios; Must use Capella (Logical Architecture); For each use case (scenario) present an Activity Diagram with Swimlanes to document how the subsystems achieve the system level functions. Clearly name all functional exchanges. Create a compact picture of the logical architecture (with allocated functions). Clone this diagram to show each of scenarios with functional chains. |
|Product Family and Release Schedule| done|Identify core architecture and derivative possibilities|
|Design Teams and Design rules| DSM matrix, refer to `Week9a:Case Study Design Structure Matrices`|Identification of the subteams responsible for completing the designbuild activities. Provide a task sequence matrix or diagram documenting the tasks for each team and the deliverables from one team to another. These deliverables may include major design decisions. |
|Modal Analysis| need `Capella` diagram and *dependent on Scenario Analysis completion*|Abstract functionality from use case sequences; Modes and sub-modes of system operation depicted with a state diagram; Must use Capella.|
|Non-functional Requirements| done |Written list of five nonfunctional requirements stated in testable form. |Written list of five nonfunctional requirements stated in testable form. |
|Capella Model| need `Capella`, folder containing a single integrated model|Use the HTML generationfeature of Capella to create an exported version of your Capella model. |
